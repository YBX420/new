\section{Introduction}
        According to the assumptions, there is no energy lost during the projectile motion between the first and the second bounces. It can therefore be assumed that the vertical component of the sphere's velocity before the second bounce is the same size but opposite in direction as the vertical component of the velocity after the first bounce. Thus, by using the SUVAT equation $v = u + at$, the time $t_p = (T_p - T_c)\times2 $ during the bounces can be determined as:

\section{Methods}
    The total game setup can be separated into three sections:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sliding Down the Tube
        \item First Free Fall
        \item Bounce and Projectile motion
    \end{itemize}
    These sections use the method of conservation of energy, SUVAT equations, coefficient of restitution, and friction to compute the theoretical value of the horizontal distance to the location of the second bounce $d_t$ from the lower end of the tube.
    
    \subsection{Sliding Down the Tube}
        In the first section, the purpose is to determine the dropping velocity of the sphere $v_r$, which is the velocity where the sphere has just left the PVC tube. This could be computed by considering the following assumptions:
        \subsubsection{Assumptions}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item There is no friction acting between the sphere and the tube.
                \item The sphere will roll without slipping.
                \item The sphere's trajectory is a perfectly straight line down the tube.
                \item The sphere will not vibrate in the tube.
                \item The sphere is freely released, without any initial velocity.
                \item The sphere has no deformation during the motion.
                \item The air resistance is negligible in the tube.
                \item Energy is conserved.
                \item The gravitational acceleration constant is $9.81Nkg^{-1}$.
            \end{itemize}

    
        \subsubsection{Determination of the value of $v_r$}
            On this occasion, the conservation of energy can be determined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta GPE = \Delta KE_t + \Delta KE_r \nonumber
            \end{equation}

        where $\Delta GPE$ is the change of gravitational energy, $\Delta KE_t$ is the change of kinetic energy, and $\Delta KE_r$ is the change of rolling kinetic energy. Due to the assumption above, the work done by the friction is negligible. Thus, the variables can be written as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\Delta GPE = mgh$ 
            \item $\Delta KE_t = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ 
            \item $\Delta KE_r = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{5}mr^2\cdot\frac{v^2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{5}mv^2$ 
        \end{itemize}
        Thus 
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                mg\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{5}mv^2 = \frac{7}{10}mv^2 \nonumber
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        In the first session of the experiment, the velocity is written as $v_r$ and the $\Delta h$ is written as $h_1$. Thus, the equation about $v_r$ and $h_1$ can be written as:
        \begin{equation}\label{vr}
            v_r = \sqrt{\frac{10gh_1}{7}}
        \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Assumption effect}
            All the assumptions are based on the fact that there is no other energy lost. Thus the assumption will cause a higher predicted value of $v_r$ and larger than the actual value.
    \subsection{Free Fall}
    In the second section, the value of $d_2$ is determined by using the SUVAT equations and several assumptions.
        \subsubsection{Assumptions}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The air resistance is negligible
                \item There is no additional rotational motion during the free fall.
                \item There is no external force acting on the system.
                \item The gravitational acceleration constant is $9.81 Nkg^{-1}$.
            \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Determine the horizontal and vertical component of the velocity}
            The horizontal and vertical force components of $v_r$ can be calculated as:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                &v_{r_x} = v_rcos\theta  &v_{r_y} = v_rsin\theta
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Determination of the value of $t$ during free fall}
            According to the SUVAT equation $s = ut +\frac{1}{2}at^2$, The equation can be written as:
            \begin{equation}
                h_2 = v_{r_y}t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \nonumber
            \end{equation}
            This equation could be solved:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    t &= \frac{-v_{r_y}\pm\sqrt{{v_{r_y}}^2+2gh_2}}{g}\\
                      &= \frac{-v_{r}sin\theta\pm\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}}{g}\\
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Determination of the horizontal displacement $d_2$ during free fall }
            According to the SUVAT equation $s = vt$, the equation of $d_2$ can be written as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        d_2 &= vt
                        \\ &= \frac{v_rcos\theta \cdot (-v_{r}sin\theta\pm\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2})}{g}
                    \end{aligned}
                \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Assumption effect}
        The air resistance and rotational motion will cause external energy lost to the system. Thus the final $v_y$ and $v_x$ values will be smaller than the expected value.
    \subsection{First and Second Bounce}
        In the third section, the value of $d_3$ is determined using the SUVAT equations, Newton's law of restitution, and several assumptions.
        \subsubsection{Assumptions}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item There is no collision time.
                \item There is no air resistance.
                \item There is no friction between the sphere and the ground.
                \item There is no rotational motion during the route.
                \item The coefficient of restitution is constant.
                \item The coefficient of restitution applies only to the vertical component of velocity
                \item Energy is conserved.
                \item The gravitational acceleration constant is $9.81Nkg^{-1}$.
            \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Determination of the vertical component of the velocity before collision}
            By using the SUVAT equation $v = u + at$, the equation about ${v^-_c}_y$ can be written as:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    {v^-_c}_y &= {v_r}_y + gt\\
                    &= v_rsin\theta + (-v_{r}sin\theta\pm\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}) \\
                    &= \pm\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Determination of the vertical component of the velocity after collision}
            The coefficient of restitution $e$ is used for the inelastic collision, the formula given is:
            \begin{equation}
                v_2 - v_1 = -e(u_2-u_1) \nonumber
            \end{equation}
            On the occasion of the experiment, the formula can be simplified to:
            \begin{equation} 
                v_y = -e\cdot u_y \nonumber
            \end{equation}
            which is 
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    {v^+_c}_y = -e\cdot {v^-_c}_y
                \end{aligned}  
            \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{During the projectile motion}
        According to the assumptions, there is no energy lost during the projectile motion between the first and the second bounces. It can therefore be assumed that the vertical component of the sphere's velocity before the second bounce is the same size but opposite in direction as the vertical component of the velocity after the first bounce. Thus, by using the SUVAT equation $v = u + at$, the time $t_p = (T_p - T_c)\times2 $ during the bounces can be determined as:
        $$-{v^+_c}_y = {v^+_c}_y - gt_p$$
        so 
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                t_p &= \frac{2{v^+_c}_y}{g}\\
                    &= \frac{\pm2e\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}}{g}
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Determination of the horizontal displacement $d_3$ during projectile}
        According to the assumption, the horizontal speed of the sphere remains constant after sliding out of the tube. It is given by the SUVAT equation that $d = vt$, so $d_3$ can be determined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                d_3 &= v_{r_x}t_p\\
                &=  \frac{\pm2ev_rcos\theta\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}}{g}
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Assumption effect}
            All the assumptions are based on there is no external energy lost. However, it is hard to determine if there is an energy transfer from rotational kinetic energy to horizontal linear kinetic energy during the collision. Thus, it is hard to determine if the actual value of $d_3$ is larger or smaller than the expected value.
\section{Results}
    \subsection{Result Calculation}
            The purpose of this experiment is to compute the horizontal distance to the location of the second bounce $d_t$ from the lower end of the tube, where $d_t = d_2 + d_3$. Thus, the equation for $d_t$ is:
            \begin{equation}\label{d_t}
                \begin{aligned}
                    d_t &= \frac{v_rcos\theta \cdot (-v_{r}sin\theta\pm\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2})}{g}\\&+\frac{\pm2ev_rcos\theta\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2}}{g} \\
                    &= v_rcos\theta \Big(\frac{-v_rsin\theta\pm(1+2e)\sqrt{{v^2_{r}sin^2\theta}+2gh_2})}{g}\Big)
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
            The parameters provided are shown in the table. With the given equation $h_1 = lsin\theta$, it can be determined that $h_1 = lsin40^\circ$.
            \begin{table}[H]
                \caption {Given Parameters} \label{parameters} 
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tabular}{cc}
                        \hline
                        Parameter & Value \\
                        \hline
                        $\theta$     & $40^\circ$     \\
                        $l$         & $1.5m$     \\
                        $e$         & $0.4979 \pm 0.0142$     \\
                        $h_2$        & $0.7m$     \\
                        $m$         & $8\times10^{-3}kg$     \\
                        \hline
                    \end{tabular}
                \end{center}
            \end{table}
            After the substitution of  $v_r = \sqrt{\frac{10gh_1}{7}}$, $h_1 = lsin40^\circ$ and given parameters, the value of $d_t$ can be determined:
            $$d_t = 1.839649037156224m = 184cm$$  
            Considering there is a deviation of $\pm 0.0142$ for the value of the coefficient of restitution $e$, two more values of $d_t$ are considered:
            \begin{align}
                &d_{t_{upper}} = 1.8754782758273496m = 188cm \nonumber\\
                &d_{t_{lower}} = 1.8038197984850983m = 180cm \nonumber
            \end{align}
            Thus, the final predicted $d_t$ is:
            \begin{equation}
                d_t = 184 \pm 4cm \label{ans:1}
            \end{equation}
    \subsubsection{Assumption Effect}
    According to the previous discussion, the predicted value of $d_2$ will be larger than the calculated value, but the value of $d_3$ is difficult to judge. Therefore the overall predicted value of $d_t$ will be lower than the calculated value.
    \subsection{Errors and Sensitive analysis}
    In addition to the given deviation of the coefficient of restitution $e$, other errors in the data may also lead to deviations in the final result. The purpose of this section is to analyse the impact of different values on the final result. The following table shows the parameters in which deviation might occur. A predicted deviation will assume these values and the final result will be computed.
    \begin{table}[H]
                \caption {Perdicted Deviation} \label{tb:deviation} 
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tabular}{cc}
                        \hline
                        Parameter & Value contains deviation \\
                        \hline
                        $\theta$     & $40\pm0.1^ \circ$     \\
                        $l$         & $1.500\pm 0.001m$     \\
                        $e$         & $0.4979 \pm 0.0142$     \\
                        $h_2$        & $0.70\pm0.01m$     \\
                        \hline
                    \end{tabular}
                \end{center}
            \end{table}
    To calculate more efficiently, a program is coded (see appendix \ref{ad:code}).
    The calculated difference between the maximum and the minimum value is $0.09974425189644576$. So the final range of the predicted value of $d_t$ is:
    $$d_t = 183.965\pm9.974cm$$
    This value is slightly larger than the predicted answer in equation \ref{ans:1}. For further analysis, two graphs are plotted by the 81 results generated by the code. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \subfigure[3d code output]{

        \subfigure[2d code output]{

        \caption{the output of the code}
        
    \end{figure}
    In the 3d plot, plot \ref{fig:3d code_output}, the x-axis represents the lunch angle $\theta$, the y-axis represents the initial height $h_2$, the z-axis represents the distance travelled $d_t$, and the size of the sphere represents the initial position of the sphere, length $l$. The 3D graph can represent the difference between different sets of values better, but it cannot easily determine the small errors. Thus, a 2D graph is drawn. 
    
    In the 2d plot, plot \ref{fig:2d code_output}, each of the three values ([0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]...) represents the impact of the error of $l$ on the data for the same $\theta$,$h_2$ and $e$. Every third number among each of the six values ([0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7]...) represents the impact of the error of $e$ on the data for the same $\theta$,$h_2$ and $l$. Every third number among each of the nine values ([0, 9, 18], [1, 10, 19]...) represents the impact of the error of $h_2$ on the data for the same $\theta$,$l$ and $e$. Finally, every third number among each of the 27 values ([0, 27, 54], [1, 28, 55]...) represents the impact of the error of $\theta$ on the data for the same $e$,$h_2$ and $l$.\par 

    The standard deviation of the whole data calculated is \textbf{0.03107009868988036}.\par
    
    Another code shown in Appendix \ref{code:p_error} is made for calculating the average percentage error. This can help determine which parameter affects the final value of $d_t$ most. With the output data, a table can be made:
    
    \begin{table}[H]

        \begin{center}

                Parameter & Average uncertainty \\
                \hline
                $l$         & $0.855069\%$     \\
                $e$         & $1.950798\%$     \\
                $h_2$       & $0.707366\%$     \\
                $\theta$    & $0.000303\%$     \\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
    \end{table}
    It shows that the value of $e$ affects the $d_t$ most, where $\theta$'s percentage uncertainty is approximately zero.

    In the whole group of 5 people, each person conducted five experiments, and the sphere landed on the A4 paper 8 times. The middle line of the paper is marked as $184cm$. The results of the experiment showed that out of 25 experiments, 7 times the sphere that hit the A4 paper landed outside $-10cm$ from the line, and the remaining 18 times the sphere landed outside $-15cm$ from the line. Among them, Dylan(DL) moved the paper forward $10cm$ in the last experiment because he found that the experimental results deviated too much from the expected value. The final result he measured was $165.5cm$.
    The table below shows the experiment results of all members of our group and their calculations.

    Among all the data, only my experiment was successful 4 out of 5 times, while the other team members all made relatively large errors. However, it is worth mentioning that all valid experimental results are within Section C. Therefore, the experimental error is relatively small, with a standard deviation of $0.455$, but the experimental error is very different from the expected error.
\section{Discussion}
    \subsection{Type of rotation of the metal sphere}
        Three occasions might occur:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rolling without slipping
            \item Slipping
            \item Skidding
        \end{itemize}
        The first section of the sphere can be seen as a sphere on the slope, as shown below in Figure \ref{simplevr}, where $F_N$ is the normal force given by the slope, $f_s$ is the rolling friction force of the sphere, $F_G$ is the weight of the sphere, and $F_D$ is the component of gravity in the direction of the slope.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{simplized_rolling_resistance.png}
            \caption{Simplified force analysis of the sphere}
            \label{simplevr}
        \end{figure}
        Through this figure, we can derive the equation about the coefficient of static friction $\mu_{sphere}$ and the angle $\theta$ to satisfy rolling without slipping. It can be used to determine the maximum $\theta$ that can achieve rolling without slipping:
        \begin{equation}\label{Friction Required for Rolling Without Slipping}
        \begin{aligned}
            \theta = arctan(\frac{7}{2}\mu)
        \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It is given that the maximum coefficient of static friction between the given material of stainless steel sphere and PVC tube $\mu$ is $0.53$ \cite{MechGuru}. By the equation \ref{Friction Required for Rolling Without Slipping}, the maximum angle $\theta$ can be computed:
        \begin{equation}
            \theta_{max} = arctan(\frac{7}{2}\times0.53) = 61.671^\circ
        \end{equation}
        It is given that $\theta$ for this experiment is $40\circ$, which is smaller than the calculated maximum value. Thus, the rotation status of the sphere could be determined as rolling without slipping, which means the assumption is \textbf{correct}.
        
        
    \subsection{Rolling down the tube}
    From the video \cite{youtube} 10s-11s, it is clear that there is a sound of the sphere colliding in the pipe. This shows that the sphere has other motion modes besides rolling down the pipe. It indicates that additional energy is lost. Due to the unexpected collision, there will be more velocity lost in the y-axis. This change will indicate a longer $d_2$, since
    \subsection{Air Resistance during free fall}
        During the free fall section, the sphere is at a relatively slow speed where there is turbulence, so the air resistance can be determined by the equation:
        \begin{equation}
            F_d = -bv
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $F_d$ is the air resistance
            \item $b$ is the constant that depends on both the material properties of the object and fluid, as well as the geometry of the object, and
            \item $v$ is the velocity
        \end{itemize}
        Due to Newton's Second law, a system of equations can be set:
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{cases}
            m\frac{dv_x}{dt} = -bv_x\\
            m\frac{dv_y}{dt} = mg-bv_y
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        After derivation (see equation \ref{y_air} and equation \ref{x_air} in appendix \ref{derviair} ), the equation set can be written as:
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{cases}
            v_x = v_0cos\theta\cdot e^{-\frac{bt}{m}}\\
            v_y = \frac{mg}{b} - e^{-\frac{tb}{m}}(\frac{mg}{b}-v_osin\theta)
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        Since the sphere is a relatively small object moving slowly through a viscous fluid, $b$ can be written as:
        \begin{equation}
            b = 6\pi\eta r \nonumber
        \end{equation}
        Thus, the equation set can be determined as
        \begin{equation}
           \begin{cases}
               v_x = v_0 cos\theta\cdot e^{-\frac{6\pi\eta tr}{m}}\\
               v_y = \frac{mg}{6\pi\eta r} - e^{-\frac{6t\pi\eta r}{m}}(\frac{mg}{6\pi\eta r}-v_osin\theta)
           \end{cases} 
        \end{equation}
        In the air, the fluid viscosity is considered as $1.8\times10^{-5}kg/(ms^{-1})$, so $b = 2.1206\times 10^{-6}$. Substitute all the known parameters into the equation, and an equation set of $v_y$ and $v_x$ is set:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{cases}
               v_x = 2.8159e^{-2.65\times10^{-4}t} \\
               v_y = 3.7\times10^4 - e^{-2.65\times10^{-4}t}(3.7\times10^4-3.6759\times\sin{40^\circ}) \nonumber 
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        With the two frames of the video\cite{youtube} recorded :
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \subfigure[Before Free Fall]{
                \label{Before Free Fall}
                \includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{time_beofre_bounce.png}
            }
            \subfigure[Time of Collision]{
                \label{Time of Collision}
                \includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{time_bounce.png}
            }
            \caption{Time used to free fall}
        \end{figure}
        $t$ is approximated to $0.19$, which means:
        \begin{equation}
           \begin{cases}
               v_x = 2.8159e^{-2.65\times10^{-4}t} = 2.8158ms^{-1} \\
               v_y = 3.7\times10^4 - e^{-2.65\times10^{-4}t}(3.7\times10^4-3.6759\times\sin{40^\circ}) = 4.2256ms^{-1} 
           \end{cases} 
        \end{equation}
        The $v_x$ and $v_y$ values are only slightly smaller than the value calculated without consideration of air resistance, which is $2.8159$ and $4.3954$, respectively. Thus, consideration of air resistance \textbf{is not the main reason} for the huge errors in the experimental and predicted values.
    \subsection{During the Bounce}
         It is observed that during the collision, there will be a deformation on the floor. The change of shape of the floor will cause uncertainty about the velocity of the sphere. Since the sphere is made of steel, the deformation of it can be negligible.

    \subsection{Proof of rolling without slipping occurs on a smooth slope} \label{proofofslide}
        The proof can be done by using the figure below:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{no_friction.png}
            \caption{Simplified force analysis of the sphere on the smooth slope}
            \label{frictionless}
        \end{figure}
        In figure \ref{frictionless}, $F_N$ is the normal force acting on the slope, $F_W$ is the weight of the sphere, and $F_D$ is the component of gravity in the direction of the slope.
        By the formula of torque:
        \begin{equation}
            \tau = rFsin\theta
        \end{equation}
        There will be a torque $\tau$ equal to $F_dr$, which represents that the overall torque of the sphere is non-equilibrium. Thus, the sphere will \textbf{rotate}.
    \subsection{Derivation of Friction Required for Rolling Without Slipping} \label{deriviationofmu}
            This section shows how to derive the equation \ref{Friction Required for Rolling Without Slipping}.
            \begin{equation} 
            \begin{aligned} 
                \Sigma F = F_D - F_R = mgsin\theta - \mu\cdot mgcos\theta = ma\\
                \label{eq:user}
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It is given that the acceleration of a sphere rolling down an incline is:
        \begin{equation}
            a_{sphere} = \frac{5}{7}gsin\theta
        \end{equation}
        Thus the minimum coefficient of static friction of the sphere to satisfy rolling without slipping could be determined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                mgsin\theta - \mu \cdot mgcos\theta &= m\frac{5}{7}gsin\theta\\
                sin\theta - \mu\cdot cos\theta &= \frac{5}{7}sin\theta\\
                \mu &= \frac{2}{7}tan\theta\\
                \theta &= arctan(\frac{7}{2}\mu)\\
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}

    \subsection{Derivation of air resistance}\label{derviair}
        \subsubsection{Horizontal Component}
        For the horizontal component:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                &m\frac{dv_x}{dt}= -bv_x\\
                &\int-\frac{b}{m}dt = \int\frac{1}{v_x}dv_x\\
                &-\frac{b}{m}t+c = ln |v_x|\\
                &v_x = e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}\cdot e^c = C_1e^{-\frac{bt}{m}}
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It is given that when $t = 0$, $v_{0_x} = v_0cos\theta$, so:
        $$C_1 = V_0cos\theta$$
        Thus
        \begin{equation} \label{x_air}
            v_x = v_0cos\theta \cdot e^{-\frac{b}{m}t}
        \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Vertical Component}
        For the vertical component:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                m\frac{dv_y}{dt} &= mg-bv_y\\
                \int \frac{m}{mg-bv_y}dv_y &= \int dt\\
                -t + c &= \frac{m}{b}ln|mg-bv_y| \\
                e^{-\frac{tb}{m} + \frac{cb}{m}} &= mg-bv_y\\
                C_2\cdot e^{-\frac{tb}{m}} &= mg-bv_y\\
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
        It is given that when $t = 0$, $v_{0_y} = v_0sin\theta$, so:
        $$C_2 = mg-bv_0sin\theta$$
        Thus
        $$(mg-bv_0sin\theta)\cdot e^{\frac{tb}{m}}(mg-bv_0sin\theta) = mg-bv_y$$
        so:
        \begin{equation} \label{y_air}
            v_y = \frac{mg}{b}-e^{-\frac{tb}{m}}(\frac{mg}{b}-v_0sin\theta)
        \end{equation}
        \subsubsection{Results}
        Thus, the horizontal component and the vertical component of the velocity can be written as:
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{cases}
            v_x = v_0cos\theta\cdot e^{-\frac{bt}{m}}\\
            v_y = \frac{mg}{b} - e^{-\frac{tb}{m}}(\frac{mg}{b}-v_osin\theta)
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
