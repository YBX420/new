    abstract = "{With rare exception,1–3 the force of friction on a rolling object is not usually a topic discussed in introductory physics textbooks. Although the invention of the wheel is one of the essential world achievements, rolling friction is typically ignored and the inability of students to explain or model the deceleration of a rolling rigid object on a rigid horizontal surface necessitates a mechanism for this phenomenon. (Detailed analyses of this mechanism and measurements of the coefficient of rolling friction can be found in Refs. 4–6.) Every introductory physics textbook discusses kinetic and static friction and many papers are devoted to teaching these forces,7 but it is well known that measuring static and kinetic friction in educational labs is troublesome.8,9 To make matters worse, the coefficient of rolling friction is much smaller than the coefficient of kinetic friction,1–5 so student measurements of rolling friction are even more troublesome. In addition, the usual measurements of time (about 1 s) and distance traveled (less than 1 m) are comparatively small, which makes surface uniformities and accurate leveling (or measuring the angle of incline) of the track critical factors that influence the uncertainty of the measurements. To counter these difficulties, a method of measuring the coefficients of rolling friction based on the oscillations of steel balls on a large concave lens was proposed in Ref. 4. This method is free from the above-named deficiencies.}",
